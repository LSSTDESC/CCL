Reporting Bugs / Contacting a Human
************************************

If you have encountered a bug in CCL report it to the `Issues <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/issues>`_ page.
This includes problems during installation, running the tests, or while using the package.
If possible, provide an example script that reproduces the error.

If you find a discrepancy between a computed quantity from CCL and another source
(or from also from CCL) please describe the quantity you are computing. If possible,
provide an example script and a plot demonstrating the inconsistency.

Finally, if all else fails, you can contact the
`administrators <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/CCL-administrators>`_ directly.
