The documentation here is provides a brief description of CCL and its contents.
For a more thorough description of the underlying equations CCL implements, see
the `CCL note <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/blob/master/doc/0000-ccl_note/0000-ccl_note.pdf>`_
and the `CCL paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05995>`_.

Cosmological Parameters
-----------------------

CCL uses the following parameters to define the cosmological model.

Background Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Omega_c``: the density fraction at z=0 of CDM
- ``Omega_b``: the density fraction at z=0 of baryons
- ``h``: the Hubble constant in units of 100 Mpc/km/s
- ``Omega_k``: the curvature density fraction at z=0
- ``Omega_g``: the density of radiation (not including massless neutrinos)
- ``w0``: first order term of the dark energy equation of state
- ``wa``: second order term of the dark energy equation of state

Power Spectrum Normalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The power spectrum normalization is given either as ``A_s`` (i.e., the primordial
amplitude) or as ``sigma8`` (i.e., a measure of the amplitude today). Note that
not all transfer functions support specifying a primordial amplitude.

- ``sigma8``: the normalization of the power spectrum today, given by the RMS
  variance in spheres of 8 Mpc/h
- ``A_s``: the primordial normalization of the power spectrum at k=0.05 Mpc :math:`^{-1}`

Relativistic Species
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Neff``: effective number of massless+massive neutrinos present at recombination
- ``m_nu``: the total mass of massive neutrinos or the masses of the massive neutrinos in eV
- ``m_nu_type``: how to interpret the ``m_nu`` argument, see the :ref:`options <mnutype>` below
- ``T_CMB``: the temperature of the CMB today

Modified Gravity Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``mu_0`` and ``sigma_0``: the parameters of the scale-independent :math:`\mu-\Sigma`
  modified gravity model
- ``df_mg`` and ``z_mg``: arrays of perturbations to the GR growth rate ``f`` as
  a function of redshift


Supported Models for the Power Spectrum, Mass Function, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------

``pyccl`` accepts strings indicating which model to use for various physical
quantities (e.g., the transfer function). The various options are as follows.

``transfer_function`` options

  - ``None`` : do not compute a linear power spectrum
  - 'eisenstein_hu': the Eisenstein and Hu (1998) fitting function
  - 'bbks': the BBKS approximation
  - 'boltzmann_class': use CLASS to compute the transfer function
  - 'boltzmann_camb': use CAMB to compute the transfer function (default)

``matter_power_spectrum`` options

  - 'halo_model': use a halo model
  - 'halofit': use HALOFIT (default)
  - 'linear': neglect non-linear power spectrum contributions
  - 'emu': use the Cosmic Emu

``baryons_power_spectrum`` options

  - 'nobaryons': neglect baryonic contributions to the power spectrum (default)
  - 'bcm': use the baryonic correction model

``mass_function`` options

  - 'tinker': the Tinker et al. (2008) mass function
  - 'tinker10': the Tinker et al. (2010) mass function (default)
  - 'watson': the Watson et al. mass function
  - 'angulo': the Angulo et al. mass function
  - 'shethtormen': the Sheth and Tormen mass function

``halo_concentration`` options

  - 'bhattacharya2011': Bhattacharya et al. (2011) relation
  - 'duffy2008': Duffy et al. (2008) relation (default)
  - 'constant_concentration': use a constant concentration

.. _mnutype:

``m_nu_type`` options

  This parameter specifies the model for massive
  neutrinos.

  - 'list': specify each mass yourself in eV
  - 'normal': use the normal hierarchy to convert total mass to individual
    masses (default)
  - 'inverted': use the inverted hierarchy to convert total mass to
    individual masses
  - 'equal': assume equal masses when converting the total mass to
    individual masses

``emulator_neutrinos`` options

  This parameter specifies how to handle inconsistencies in the treatment of
  neutrinos between the Cosmic Emu (equal masses) and other models.

  - 'strict': fail unless things are absolutely consistent (default)
  - 'equalize': redistribute the total mass equaly before using the Cosmic
    Emu. This option may result in slight internal inconsistencies in the
    physical model assumed for neutrinos.


Controlling Splines and Numerical Accuracy
------------------------------------------

The internal splines and integration accuracy are controlled by the global
instances :obj:`pyccl.spline_params` and :obj:`pyccl.gsl_params`.
Upon instantiation, the :obj:`pyccl.Cosmology` object assumes the accuracy
parameters from these instances. For example, you can set the generic relative
accuracy for integration by executing
``pyccl.gsl_params.INTEGRATION_EPSREL = 1e-5`` or
``pyccl.gsl_params["INTEGRATION_EPSREL"] = 1e-5``. To reset the accuracy
parameters to their default valus listed in ``src/ccl_core.c``, you may run
``pyccl.gsl_params.reload()`` or ``pyccl.spline_params.reload()``.

.. note::
   Previously, the indicated way of setting the accuracy parameters was
   after instantiation of a :obj:`Cosmology` object. For mutation consinstency,
   this functionality is now deprecated and will raise an error in the future.

The internal splines are controlled by the following
parameters.

  - A_SPLINE_NLOG: the number of logarithmically spaced bins between
    A_SPLINE_MINLOG and A_SPLINE_MIN.
  - A_SPLINE_NA: the number of linearly spaced bins between
    A_SPLINE_MIN and A_SPLINE_MAX.
  - A_SPLINE_MINLOG: the minimum value of the scale factor splines used for
    distances, etc.
  - A_SPLINE_MIN: the transition scale factor between logarithmically spaced
    spline points and linearly spaced spline points.
  - A_SPLINE_MAX: the the maximum value of the scale factor splines used for
    distances, etc.

    for the power spectrum splines.

    spaced spline points and linearly spaced spline points for the power
    spectrum.
  - K_MIN: the minimum wavenumber for the power spectrum splines for
    analytic models (e.g., BBKS, Eisenstein & Hu, etc.).
  - K_MAX: the maximum wavenumber for the power spectrum splines for
    analytic models (e.g., BBKS, Eisenstein & Hu, etc.).

  - N_K: the number of spline nodes per decade for the power spectrum
    splines.

    correlation function computations with FFTlog.

    correlation function computations with FFTlog.
  - N_ELL_CORR: the number of logarithmically spaced bins in angular
    wavenumber between ELL_MIN_CORR and ELL_MAX_CORR.

Specifying Physical Constants
-----------------------------

The values of physical constants are set globally and are frozen. We do not
recommend changing them, as some constants derive from others (such as Newton's
gravitational constant and the solar mass). However, if you know what you are
doing, you can unfreeze with ``pyccl.physical_constants.unfreeze()`` and then
set your desired value to the parameter you would like to change.
The following constants are defined and their default values are located
in ``src/ccl_core.c``. Note that the neutrino mass splittings are taken
from Lesgourgues & Pastor (2012; 1212.6154). Also, see the
`CCL note <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/blob/master/doc/0000-ccl_note/0000-ccl_note.pdf>`_
for a discussion of the values of these constants from different sources.
