Citing CCL
**********

This code has been released by DESC, although it is still under active development.
It is accompanied by a journal paper that describes the development and validation of `CCL`,
which you can find on the `arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05995>`_. If you make use of
the ideas or software here, please cite that paper and provide a link to the repository
``https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL``. You are welcome to re-use the code, which is open source and
available under terms consistent with our `LICENSE <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/blob/master/LICENSE>`_
(`BSD 3-Clause <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_).

External contributors and DESC members wishing to use CCL for non-DESC projects
should consult with the TJP working group conveners, ideally before the work has
started, but definitely before any publication or posting of the work to the arXiv.

For free use of the ``CLASS`` library, the ``CLASS`` developers require that the
``CLASS`` paper be cited, CLASS II: Approximation schemes, D. Blas, J. Lesgourgues, T. Tram, arXiv:1104.2933, JCAP 1107 (2011) 034.
The ``CLASS`` repository can be found in http://class-code.net.
