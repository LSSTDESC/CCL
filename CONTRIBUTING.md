HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
---------------------------------------

This file contains guidelines on how to contribute to the development of CCL.
If you want to make changes to CCL, please follow the procedures listed here
to make sure that they conform to our coding standards, and that all of the
necessary files, wrappers etc. are properly updated.

Developers should seek consensus with the CCL team as needed about new features
being incorporated (especially for API changes or additions).

Reviewing a pull request (PR) on github
---------------------------------------
 1. Checkout the branch.
 2. Make sure you can build the C library (i.e. `cmake .. && make` from the `build` directory).
 3. Make sure you can build the python module (i.e. `python setup.py build` from
    the root directory).
 4. Make sure the C unit tests pass (i.e. run `build/check_ccl` from the root
    directory successfully).
 5. Make sure the python tests pass (i.e. run `pytest -vv pyccl` from the
    root directory successfully).
 6. Make sure the benchmarks pass (i.e. run `pytest -vv benchmarks` from the
   root directory successfully).
 7. Make sure flake8 is not generating any warnings on pyccl (i.e., run `flake8 pyccl`).
 8. Look at the code (see "Files changed" on the top of the GitHub pull request
    page) and check that the changes make sense to you.
 9. If new science has been implemented, and if possible, try to compare the
    output of the code against your own predictions. Ask the developer to
    implement appropriate unit tests for it.
 10. Make sure that the unit tests pass on Travis-CI.
 11. Make sure that the changes come with documentation, e.g. internally in the
    C code and through Python docstrings. Make sure that example code in the `examples/`
    directory has been updated appropriately, and that the CCL note has been
    updated if necessary (including your affiliation and contribution in
    `authors.csv`).

Things to do if you are adding new features to the CCL C lib
------------------------------------------------------------
 1. If you haven't created a new files (i.e. you only edited an existing one),
    you don't need to do any of this.
 2. When adding a new source file (.c), put it in `src/`. The new file should be
    added to the `CCL_SRC` list in `CMakeLists.txt`.
 3. When adding a new header file (.h), put it in `include/`. It
    should have documentation strings.
 4. When adding new unit test files, they should be listed under
    `TEST_SRC` in `CMakeLists.txt`.
 5. Any other new files that should be included with the library (e.g.
    documentation files) should be listed under `EXTRA_DIST` in `CMakeLists.txt`.
 6. Generally `CMakeLists.txt` may have to be modified when adding new features
    (e.g. adding a new dependency).
 7. Any updates to CCL should be documented in the CCL note that you can find
    in `doc/0000-ccl_note/`. You will need to edit `main.tex`, compile with `make`,
    and commit your changes, including the updated PDF file. Make sure you update
    your institution and your contribution in `authors.csv` as well.

Notes on CMake:
 - To install the library, users will run:
     ```sh
     $ mkdir build && cd build
     $ cmake ..
     $ make install
     ```
 - Once the library is compiled and installed, all C unit tests are run by
   typing `check_ccl` from the root CCL folder.

Adding new benchmarks
---------------------------------------------------------
Every new feature in CCL is benchmarked against an independent implementation.
If you are adding a new feature, make sure someone can provide you with
an independent output for cross-checks. Independent codes should be
publicly available and linked in the benchmark tab
of the wiki, and a script to run them should
be provided such that the user can reproduce the benchmarks.

Benchmarks should be integrated in automated python tests following the current
examples in `benchmarks/`. Any plots that check the results of the comparison
should be added to the `Benchmark_Comparison.ipynb` notebook in the
`examples` folder. New features and tests should also be documented
in the CCL note in the `doc` directory.


Modifying the Python wrapper
---------------------------------------------------------
If you make changes to the public CCL API, you will also have to update the
Python wrapper. The most important task is to make sure your new or modified
functions are properly exposed to the user through the wrapper. This should be
quite straightforward in most instances.

To do this, examine the following files (where <modulename> is the name of the
CCL module that your new/modified function belongs to; e.g. 'background', if
the function is in `ccl_background.c`):

 - `pyccl/<modulename>.i`: These are the SWIG interface files, and mostly handle
   things like vectorizing C functions. This is usually done by adding a loop
   over the indices of the input array, and by providing a function call
   signature that can be used to accept numpy arrays. See function names ending
   in `_vec` in the interface file for examples. If you changed the call
   signature of a function, there is a good chance you'll have to also change
   it in the corresponding interface file.
 - `pyccl/<modulename>.py`: These are Python wrappers around the auto-generated
   SWIG wrapper (which is only exposed through the `pyccl.lib` namespace). They
   are there to present a more 'Pythonic' interface to the user, for example by
   wrapping CCL structs in more user-friendly classes, automatically handling
   memory management logic, and doing type checking and error checking.
   These files are where you should define classes to manage CCL objects (see
   the `Cosmology` class in `pyccl/core.py` for example), and
   where you should provide easy-to-use wrappers around more complicated
   functions provided through the basic SWIG wrapper. Ideally, you would also
   provide some type checking and error checking code in this part of the
   wrapper.
 - `pyccl/__init__.py`: This file is used to define the top-level user
   interface of the `pyccl` module. You should make sure that your new/modified
   functions are imported.

If you added new functions to the interface, you should also take a look in
the following files:

 - `pyccl/ccl.i`: This is the root interface file, and includes all of the
   interface files. If you added a new module to CCL, you will probably need to
   create a `<modulename>.i` file for it. Once you've done that, include it in
   `ccl.i` and it should be automatically picked up by the build system.
 - `pyccl/pyutils.py`: This file contains convenience functions for calling CCL
   functions that take numpy array input/output arguments, and for passing the
   `Cosmology` class as an argument to a function in the SWIG wrapper. Use
   these if possible, instead of writing your own wrapper code for individual
   functions.

After these changes have been made, you should update the `swig` interface by
running:
```sh
$ python setup.py build
```
from the root `CCL` directory.

Once you have finished making changes to the wrapper, check to make sure
everything is operational by running the Python unit tests.
From the top-level directory of the CCL sources, and assuming that
you have recompiled and reinstalled the C library and the Python wrapper, run:
  `$ pytest -vv pyccl`
This may take some time to run in its entirety. If you changed the API, you may
have to modify the tests to account for this. You should also add your own
tests for any new functions or behaviors that were added.

The python syntax can be checked with `flake8 pyccl`. You should run this
command as part of the tests while developing `pyccl` features. More information
on the capabilities of `flake8` can be found in http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/manpage.html.

Occasionally, modifications made correctly as described above will still not
function properly. This might be due to multiple `pyccl` installation files not being
properly overwritten, and the interpreter is getting confused which version to
use. At this point it is often best to resort to the "nuclear option" of
deleting all python files related to `pyccl` and starting from scratch. The
procedure is as follows:

 1. Run clean scripts

   - Execute `pip uninstall pyccl` (try it multiple times to make sure you got
     all installed versions of `pyccl`)

 2. Delete built/installed python files

   - Execute `rm -r build/` to delete the build directory

   - Execute `rm pyccl/ccl_wrap.c pyccl/ccllib.py` to delete the autogenerated swig files

   - Check your `~/.local/lib` directory for any `pyccl` files (they will be in
     one of the python directories), and delete them.

   - Still not working? You can execute `python setup.py install [args] --record files.txt`.
     The file `files.txt` will contain a list of all files written when calling the install script with arguments `args`. Perhaps there are files somewhere else on your system!

 3. You can now rebuild the python package in the normal way:
 ```sh
$ python setup.py build
 ```

Debug mode in Python
--------------------------------------------
Because of the way the Python wrapper handles exceptions that occur inside the C code, by default
users will only see error messages for the most recent error to occur. If multiple errors occurred
during a CCL function call, all but the most recent error message will be overwritten. This can
make it difficult to debug the root cause of a problem.

To help with debugging this kind of issue, you can enable debug mode in the Python wrapper. To do
this, simply call `pyccl.debug_mode(True)`. This will cause the Python wrapper to print all C
error messages to `stderr` whenever they occur. Python exceptions will only be raised for the most
recent error, as before, but you can at least see if other exceptions were thrown by inspecting
the `stderr` output.

(Note that Jupyter notebooks do not print `stderr` messages by default.)

API Changes and Stability
--------------------------------------------
An API breakage is anything that modifies the name or call signature of an
existing public-facing function or variable (e.g. any function with the prefix
`ccl_` in the C headers). Changes to keyword arguments of Python functions also
fit this description, unless they are explicitly made backwards-compatible.
Significant changes to the behaviour of a function also count as an API
breakage (e.g. if an assumption is changed that causes different results to be
produced by default). Fixing a bug that affects the output of a function does
not count as an API breakage, unless the fix modifies function names and
arguments too.

If the API is broken, the CCL version number must be incremented (e.g. from
v0.1 to v0.2), and a new tagged release should be made shortly after the
changes are pushed to master. The new release must include notes in
`CHANGELOG.md` that describe how the API has been changed. The aim is to make
it clear to users how their CCL-based code might be affected if they update to
the latest version, especially if the update is likely to break something. All
API changes should be discussed with the CCL team before being pushed to the
`master` branch.

There is not yet any absolute need to preserve backwards-compatibility between
point releases (e.g. v0.2 does not need to support everything that v0.1 did).
This will change as the code matures, though. After v1.0 is released, we expect
to maintain backwards compatibility for all releases with the same major
version number, i.e. v1.1 should support all the same behaviors that v1.0
supported, plus whatever new additions are made.

See section below for instructions on how to deploy a new release.

Compiling the CCL note
--------------------------------------------
After making changes to the library, you should document them in the CCL note.
The note is found in the directory `doc/0000-ccl_note/`. To compile the note,
type `make` in that directory. If you do not have `pip` installed, please edit
the `Makefile` to agree with your setup. If you do not have admin permission,
then you will need to set up a virtual environment to install the note. This
is done as follows. Set up the virtual environment once:
  ```sh
  $ virtualenv CCL
  ```
and after a new login:
  ```sh
  $ source CCL/activate
  $ make
  ```
If you need to modify the note, the files to modify are:

 - `authors.csv`: To document your contribution.

 - `main.tex`: To detail the changes to the library.

 - `main.bib`: To add new references.

Travis-CI
--------------------------------------------

Travis-CI is a continuous integration tool that reads the file `.travis.yml`
and performs the steps described there in a virtual environment. More details
can be found here: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/

Every time you perform a commit Travis-CI will automatically try to build the
libraries with your new changes and run the unit tests. You can check the
status of your build here: https://travis-ci.org/LSSTDESC/CCL/builds. If you
click in your build you will find more information about its status and a log
describing the process. If your build errors or fails, you can scroll through
the log to find out what went wrong. Warnings from flake8 will result in tests not passing. If your additions require new dependencies
make sure that you include them in `.travis.yml`.


Creating a new release and deploying on PyPi
--------------------------------------------

When cutting a new release, the procedure is as follows:
  - Make sure any API changes are documented in `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Commit to master
  - Create a new release from the GitHub interface here: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/releases/new

This will trigger a new Travis build and automatically upload the new version to
PyPi.

This should not be necessary, but in case a release needs to be manually uploaded
to PyPi, the procedure is as follows:
  - Manually create a source distribution from the root CCL folder:
  ```
  $ python setup.py sdist
  ```
  This will create a .tar.gz file in the `dist` folder

  - Upload source distribution to PyPi using `twine` (can be installed using `pip`):
  ```
  $ twine upload  dist/pyccl-x.x.x.tar.gz
  ```
  Make sure your `twine` and `setuptools` are up to date, otherwise the markdown
  formatting of the README.md will not be correctly processed on the CCL PyPi page.


Technical Notes on the Python Wrapper
-------------------------------------

The Python wrapper is built using the `swig` tool, which automatically scans
the `CCL` C headers and builds a matching interface in Python. The
autogenerated `swig` interface can be accessed through the `pyccl.lib` module.
A more user-friendly wrapper has been written on top of
this to provide more structure to the module, allowing `numpy` vectorization,
and providing more natural Python classes.

The key parts/conventions of the wrapper are as follows:

- Interface `.i` files: These are kept in the `pyccl/` directory, and tell
  `swig` which functions to extract from the C headers. There are also commands
  in these files to generate basic function argument documentation, and
  to remove the `ccl_` prefix from function names. The interface files also
  contain code that tells `swig` how to convert C array arguments to `numpy`
  arrays. For certain functions, this code may also contain a simple loop
  to vectorize the function.

- Main interface file `pyccl/ccl.i`: This file imports all of the other interface
  files. Most of the `CCL` source files (e.g. `core.c`) have their own interface
  file too. For other files, mostly containing support/utility functions, `swig`
  only needs the C header (`.h`) file to be specified in the main `ccl.i` file,
  however.

- Internal CCL C-level state: All global state in the `CCL` library
  (e.g., whether or not the power spectra splines are initialized and calling the
  function to initialize them) is controlled by the python code. This ensures that
  when the C code is running, all data needed already exists. It also allows us
  to more easily use OpenMP in the C layer, avoiding the problem of having to manage
  the global state from more than one thread. In practice, this means that before
  you call the `CCL` C library from python, you need to check to make sure that
  any internal C data you need has been initialized. The `pyccl.Cosmology` object
  has methods to help with this (e.g., `compute_distances()`).
