Summary of changes wrt the pre-autotools version:
---------------------------------------------------------
 - No Makefile: everything is now defined in
     Makefile.am
     include/Makefile.am
     class/Makefile.am
 - When adding new files to src, the new file should
   be listed under libccl_la_SOURCES in Makefile.am
 - When adding new files to include, the new file
   should be listed under include_HEADERS in
   include/Makefile.am
 - When adding new unit test files, they should be
   listed under check_ccl_SOURCES in Makefile.am
 - Any other new files that should be included with
   the library (e.g. documentation files) should be
   listed under EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am.
 - The file configure.ac may have to be modified when
   adding new features, but not too often.
 - After making changes to any of these files, developers
   should run:
      $> autoreconf -i
   and commit any modified files (some files will be
   automatically modified by this command).
 - From now on, to install the library, users will run:
     $> configure <options>
     $> make
     $> make install
 - Once the library is installed, all unit tests are
   run by typing:
     $> make check
 - A tarball with all files needed to install the library
   can be created automatically by typing:
     $> make dist

Modifying the Python wrapper
---------------------------------------------------------
If you make changes to the public CCL API, you will also have to update the
Python wrapper. The most important task is to make sure your new or modified
functions are properly exposed to the user through the wrapper. This should be
quite straightforward in most instances.

To do this, examine the following files (where <modulename> is the name of the
CCL module that your new/modified function belongs to; e.g. 'background', if the
function is in ccl\_background.c):

 - pyccl/<modulename>.i: These are the SWIG interface files, and mostly handle
   things like vectorizing C functions. This is usually done by adding a loop
   over the indices of the input array, and by providing a function call
   signature that can be used to accept numpy arrays. See function names ending
   in '\_vec' in the interface file for examples. If you changed the call
   signature of a function, there is a good chance you'll have to also change
   it in the corresponding interface file.
 - pyccl/<modulename>.py: These are Python wrappers around the auto-generated
   SWIG wrapper (which is only exposed through the pyccl.lib namespace). They
   are there to present a more 'Pythonic' interface to the user, for example by
   wrapping CCL structs in more user-friendly classes, automatically handling
   memory management logic, and doing type checking and error checking.
   These files are where you should define classes to manage CCL objects (see
   the Parameters and Cosmology classes in pyccl/core.py for example), and
   where you should provide easy-to-use wrappers around more complicated
   functions provided through the basic SWIG wrapper. Ideally, you would also
   provide some type checking and error checking code in this part of the
   wrapper.
 - pyccl/\_\_init\_\_.py: This file is used to define the top-level user interface
   of the pyccl module. You should make sure that your new/modified functions
   are imported.

If you added new functions to the interface, you should also take a look in
the following files:

 - pyccl/ccl.i: This is the root interface file, and includes all of the
   interface files. If you added a new module to CCL, you will probably need to
   create a <modulename>.i file for it. Once you've done that, include it in
   ccl.i and it should be automatically picked up by the build system.
 - pyccl/pyutils.py: This file contains convenience functions for calling CCL
   functions that take numpy array input/output arguments, and for passing the
   Cosmology() class as an argument to a function in the SWIG wrapper. Use
   these if possible, instead of writing your own wrapper code for individual
   functions.

Once you have finished making changes to the wrapper, check to make sure
everything is operational by running the Python unit tests in the tests/
directory. From the top-level directory of the CCL sources, and assuming that
you have recompiled and reinstalled the C library and the Python wrapper, run:

  $ python tests/run\_tests.py

This may take some time to run in its entirety. If you changed the API, you may
have to modify the tests to account for this. You should also add your own
tests for any new functions or behaviors that were added.

Coding Conventions
------------------

We have not yet adopted a specific coding style guide, but the
[LSST DM Style Guides](https://developer.lsst.io/coding/intro.html) are
under consideration.

In order to ensure consistent white-space conventions, we provide an
[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) file that can be used to automatically
configure many code editors to follow our recommendations:
 - No trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
 - Use 4 spaces for indentation in C and python code.
 - Always end a C or python source file with a newline.
