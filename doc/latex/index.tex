The Core Cosmology Library (C\+CL) provides routines to compute basic cosmological observables with validated numerical accuracy. In the current version, predictions are provided for distances and background quantities, an gular auto-\/ and cross-\/spectra of cosmic shear and clustering, correlation functions and the halo mass function. Fiducial specifications for the expected L\+S\+ST galaxy distributions and clustering bias are also included, together with a facility to compute redshift distributions for a user-\/defined photometric redshift model. C\+CL is written in C with a Python interface.\hypertarget{index_Installation}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_Installation}
