C\+CL uses the C\+Test framework (\href{https://github.com/bvdberg/ctest}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/bvdberg/ctest}) to write its unit tests. Although lacking a few of the fancy features of more comprehensive frameworks it is lightweight and can be completely included with the C\+CL, in the file tests/ctest.\+h

To add a new set of tests to the system\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Create a new file tests/your\+\_\+tests.\+c
\item Add your tests to that file. You do not need a \char`\"{}main\char`\"{} function. See the examples in tests/ccl\+\_\+test\+\_\+params.\+c for how to write tests, which should use the ctest assertions to check they are working (see the sparse documentation at \href{https://github.com/bvdberg/ctest}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/bvdberg/ctest}).
\item In the C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt add tests/your\+\_\+tests.\+c to the \char`\"{}\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+S\+R\+C\char`\"{} list towards the top of the file
\item Run \char`\"{}check\+\_\+ccl\char`\"{} to run all your tests
