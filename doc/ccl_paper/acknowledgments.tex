%In addition
We would like to thank the organisers of the the DESC meetings at: CMU (July 2018), Oxford (July 2016), SLAC (Ferurary 2018, March 2016), and ANL (2015), and the LSST-DESC Hack Week organisers (CMU, November 2016), where this work was partly developed. We would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the participants of the Theory and Joint Probes Code Comparison Project, some of whom are among the \ccl contributors, for providing the benchmarks for testing CCL. We also acknowledge Louis Penafiel and Elizabeth Kimura, who developed the {\tt VARRIC} code to compare and visualize power spectra calculated by {\tt CCL} and {\tt CLASS}. We thank Pedro Ferreira for feedback on this manuscript. Finally, we are grateful for the feedback received from other working groups of DESC, including Strong Lensing, Supernovae, Clusters and Photometric Redshifts.
We thank Peter Williams for making his ApJ bibstyle file available at \url{https://github.com/pkgw/tex-stuff/blob/master/yahapj.bst}. We are grateful to Katrin Heitmann and Earl Lawerence for discussions concerning the Cosmic Emulator. We are also thankful to the {\tt CLASS} authors and to Andrew Hamilton for making their codes available and allowing us to use them in this work.
