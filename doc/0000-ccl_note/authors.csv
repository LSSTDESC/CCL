#,,,,,,
# While we wait for the LSST DESC publications system to generate files,,,,,,
# like this from its database, we'll need to edit authors.csv by hand.,,,,,
# Below are some example entries.,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# Notes:,,,,,,
#   - If someone has two affiliations, they get two rows, and the last row is,,,,
#     is used for their contribution.,,,,,,
#   - mkauthlist cannot deal with empty rows, so please avoid them!,,,,,
#   - Try to make your one-sentence contribution statement as informative as,,,,,,
#     possible, so that it's clear who did what.,,,,,
#   - The contribution statement is a _summary of your impact on the project_,,,,,,
#     not a _timecard_. So, if you spent 90% of your time debugging, but 10%,,,,
#     of your time designing and implementing the framework that then needed,,,,,,
#     debugging, your statement should emphasize the design and implementation,,,,,
#     rather than the debugging.,,,,,,
#   - BUG: contributions are re-formatted by mkauthlist into Title case,,,,,,
#     removing all other capitalizations. Sorry about this!,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# Example rows for you to adapt:,,,,,,
