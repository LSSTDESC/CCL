We would like to thank the organisers of the the DESC collaboration meetings at:
Oxford (July 2016), SLAC (March 2016), and ANL (2015), 
and the LSST-DESC Hack Week organisers (CMU, November 2016), where this work 
was partly developed. We would also like to acknowledge the
contribution of the participants of the TJP Code Comparison Project, some of whom
are among the CCL contributors, for providing the benchmarks for 
testing CCL. Finally, we are grateful for the feedback received from
other working groups of DESC, including Strong Lensing, Supernovae
and Photometric Redshifts.
