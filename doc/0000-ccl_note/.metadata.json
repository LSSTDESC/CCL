    "title": "Core Cosmology Library: Precision Cosmological Predictions for LSST",
    "description": "The Core Cosmology Library ({\tt CCL}) provides routines to compute basic cosmological observables with validated numerical accuracy. These routines have been validated to a hereby documented accuracy level against the results of the Code Comparsion Project. In the current version, predictions are provided for distances and background quantities, angular auto- and cross-spectra of cosmic shear and clustering and the halo mass function. Fiducial specifications for the expected LSST galaxy distributions and clustering bias are also included, together with a facility to compute redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. {\tt CCL} is written in C with a Python interface. In this note, we explain the functionality of the first release ({\tt CCL} v0.1) of the library. ",
